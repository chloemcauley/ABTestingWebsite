# A/B Testing Website


## Introduction

The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. This project aims to help the company to understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment for longer to make their decision. 

## Summary of Findings

It was found from the p-value and the z-score that we were unable to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the new page did not lead to more users compared to the old page. By adding geographic location of the users, it was also found that countries such as USA, Canada, or the UK had no significant increase in the conversion rates. Therefore, it is advised that the company should not implement the new page as it will save time and money for the company. Instead, they should try out different features and try the A/B test again. 

## Learning Outcomes

* Created a hyptothesis and tested it to investigate whether the new page resulted in better conversions compared to the old page.
* The data was bootstrapped and sampling distributions were determined for both old and new pages.
* p-values were calculated and determined whether the the null hypothesis would be rejected or not.
* Logistic regression was used to confirm the previous steps.
